Machine Project for LBYARCH course 


The assembly implementation is faster than the C.
For efficiency, assembly code is faster but functional correctness is important. 
Debugging assembly is harder than debugging C. 
The assembly has more potential for faster execution. While both highlights high performance. 
Because assembly performs better, it demands focus and attention to detail to achieve the expected and accurate results.
